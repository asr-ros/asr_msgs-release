%description
This package contains all messages that are particular to our Active Scene
Recognition - Framework at Humanoids and Intelligence Systems Lab (HIS),
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). These messages make up the interfaces
between the different collaborating components of this system. They are of
critical importance and structured by the ROS communication capabilities.

# in the install tree that was dropped by catkin, and source it.  It will
